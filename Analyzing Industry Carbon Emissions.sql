--QUESTION 1
--Using the product_emissions table, find the number of unique companies and their total carbon footprint PCF for each industry group,
--filtering for the most recent year in the database. The query should return three columns: industry_group, num_companies, 
--and total_industry_footprint, with the last column being rounded to one decimal place. 
--The results should be sorted by total_industry_footprint from highest to lowest values.

SELECT industry_group,COUNT(DISTINCT(company)) AS num_companies, ROUND(SUM(carbon_footprint_pcf), 1) AS total_industry_footprint
FROM product_emissions
	WHERE year= (SELECT max(year) FROM product_emissions)
GROUP BY industry_group
ORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC;
